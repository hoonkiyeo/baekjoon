### Brute-force Algorithms

- There are 5 algorithm problems in step11.
- Brute Force algorithm is a typical problem-solving technique where the possible solution for a problem is uncovered by checking each answer one by one, by determining whether the result satisfies the statement of a problem or not. It is used when the problem size is limited since its various tries are equally proportional to a solutionâ€™s candidates.
